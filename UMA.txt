Resource owners configure authorization servers with access policies that serve as asynchronous authorization grants.

-----Terminology-----
protection API token (PAT): An OAuth access token with the scope uma_protection, used by the resource server at the protection API, consisting of the resource set registration, permission registration, and token introspection endpoints.
resource set registration endpoint: An endpoint at the authorization server that allows the resource server to register resource sets.
permission registration endpoint: An endpoint at the authorization server that allows the resource server to request permission tickets.
token introspection endpoint: An endpoint at the authorization server that allows the resource server to query the status of an RPT and its associated authorization data.

authorization API token (AAT): An OAuth access token with the scope uma_authorization, used by the client at the authorization API, consisting of the RPT endpoint.
RPT endpoint: An endpoint at the authorization server that issues RPTs and authorization data to the client.
requesting party token (RPT): An UMA access token associated with a set of authorization data, used by the client to gain access to protected resources at the resource server.
authorization data: Data associated with an RPT that enables some combination of the authorization server and resource server to determine the correct extent of access to allow to a client.
