-----Client Registration-----
Specify the client type
confidential - a confidential server-based component
public - a public browser-based component

The authorization server issues the registered client a client identifier -- a unique string
client identifier string size is left undefined.

Confidential clients are typically issued (or establish) a set of client credentials

The client identifier and password are encoded using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
HTTP Basic authentication scheme for authenticating clients.
client credentials parameters can only be transmitted in the request-body.
authorization server MUST require the use of TLS.

provide its client redirection URIs
include any other information required by the authorization server(application name, redirect uri)


-----Protocol Endpoints-----
Authorization endpoint:
authorization server MUST first verify the identity of the resource owner, SHOULD require the use of TLS.
response_type MUST be one of "code" for requesting an authorization code, "token" for requesting an access token or a registered extension value.
If an authorization request is missing the "response_type" parameter, or if the response type is not understood, the authorization server MUST return an error response

client's redirection endpoint previously established during the client registration process or when making the authorization request, MUST be an absolute URI.
Lack of a redirection URI registration requirement can enable an attacker to use the authorization endpoint

If multiple redirection URIs have been registered, if only part of the redirection URI has been registered, or if no redirection URI has been registered, the client MUST include a redirection URI with the authorization request using the "redirect_uri" request parameter.
If an authorization request fails validation, authorization server SHOULD inform the resource owner

Token endpoint:
