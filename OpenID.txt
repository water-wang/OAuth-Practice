Requested by Clients by including the openid scope value in the Authorization Request.
Information about the authentication performed is returned in a JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT] called an ID Token
OAuth 2.0 Authentication Servers implementing OpenID Connect are also referred to as OpenID Providers (OPs).
OAuth 2.0 Clients using OpenID Connect are also referred to as Relying Parties (RPs).

OpenID Connect performs authentication to log in the End-User or to determine that the End-User is already logged in.


------OpenID Connect Core------
With OpenID, you maintain your profile only at your OpenID provider, and all the other sites become OpenID relying parties. These “talk” with your OpenID provider to obtain your information.

OpenID Code Flow:
1. Client prepares an Authentication Request containing the desired request parameters.
2. Client sends the request to the Authorization Server.
3. Authorization Server authenticates the End-User.
4. Authorization Server obtains End-User Consent/Authorization.
5. Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with code.
6. Client sends the code to the Token Endpoint to receive an Access Token and ID Token in the response.
7. Client validates the tokens and retrieves the End-User's Subject Identifier.

Authentication Request:
1. response_type
2. client_id
3. scope
4. redirect_uri
5. state
6. prompt: whether the Authorization Server prompts the End-User for reauthentication and consent
7. max_age: elapsed time in seconds since the last time the End-User was actively authenticated by the OP
8. id_token_hint: ID Token previously issued by the Authorization Server being passed as a hint about the End-User's current or past authenticated session with the Client

Client Receives Tokens:
1. access_token: Access Token for the UserInfo Endpoint
2. token_type: Bearer
3. id_token
4. expires_in
5. refresh_token

ID Token: The sub and iss Claims, used together, are the only Claims that an RP can rely upon as a stable identifier for the End-User
1. iss: Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response. authorization server url
2. sub: unique and never reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User
3. aud: client_id of the Relying Party as an audience value
4. exp: Expiration time on or after which the ID Token
5. iat: Time at which the JWT was issued
6. auth_time: Time when the End-User authentication occurred.

ID Token Validation:
1. The Issuer Identifier for the OpenID Provider (which is typically obtained during Discovery) MUST exactly match the value of the iss (issuer) Claim.
2. The Client MUST validate that the aud (audience) Claim contains its client_id value registered at the Issuer identified by the iss (issuer) Claim as an audience.
3. If the ID Token contains multiple audiences, the Client SHOULD verify that an azp Claim is present. If an azp (authorized party) Claim is present, the Client SHOULD verify that its client_id is the Claim Value.
4. The current time MUST be before the time represented by the exp Claim
5. The iat Claim can be used to reject tokens that were issued too far away from the current time
6. If the acr Claim was requested, the Client SHOULD check that the asserted Claim Value is appropriate.
7. When a max_age request is made, the Client SHOULD check the auth_time Claim value

UserInfo Endpoint:
request: GET /userinfo HTTP/1.1 Access Token
response: sub (subject) Claim MUST always be returned, MUST be verified to exactly match the sub Claim in the ID Token

Scope Values: To minimize the amount of information that the End-User is being asked to disclose
1. openid
2. profile: the End-User's default profile Claims
3. email
4. address
5. phone
6. offline_access: requests Refresh Token be issued that can be used to obtain an Access Token that grants access to the End-User's UserInfo Endpoint even when the End-User is not logged in
Multiple scope values MAY be used by creating a space-delimited, case-sensitive list

Standard Claims: The UserInfo Endpoint MUST return Claims in JSON format
1. sub
2. name
3. profile
4. picture
5. website
6. email
7. gender
8. birthdate
9. address: formatted, street_address, locality, region, postal_code, country
10. etc.


------OpenID Connect Discovery------
OpenID Connect uses WebFinger to locate the OpenID Provider for an End-User.

OpenID Provider Issuer discovery: 
determinthe location of the OpenID Provider.
GET /.well-known/webfinger
Request: resource, host, rel(http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer)
Response: links array element with href and rel

The purpose of Identifier normalization:
determine normalized Resource and Host values from the user input Identifier. 
The user input Identifier SHOULD be a URL or URI relative reference.

User Input using E-Mail Address
User Input using URL
User Input using Hostname and Port
User Input using "acct" URI Syntax

response: a subset of Metadata.

Clients and protected resources SHOULD cache this discovery information valid for at least one week.

QUESTIONS: 
1. how does webfinger server host?

------OpenID Connect Dynamic Registration------
Client Metadata:
redirect_uris: One of these registered Redirection URI values MUST exactly match the redirect_uri parameter value used in each Authorization Request
response_types: default is that the Client will use only the code Response Type
grant_types: authorization_code, implicit, refresh_token
	response_type 		- 		grant_types
	code 				- 		authorization_code
	id_token  			-		implicit
	token id_token 		- 		implicit
	code id_token 		- 		authorization_code, implicit
	code token 			- 		authorization_code, implicit
	code token id_token - 		authorization_code, implicit
application_type: native or web, web must use the https scheme as redirect_uris
contacts
client_name
client_uri
policy_uri
tos_uri: terms of service
subject_type: pairwise and public
token_endpoint_auth_method: options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none
default_max_age 


Client Registration Endpoint:
To support open Dynamic Registration, the Client Registration Endpoint SHOULD accept registration requests without OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens.
These requests MAY be rate-limited or otherwise limited to prevent a denial-of-service attack on the Client Registration Endpoint.
POST /connect/register HTTP/1.1
request: Client Metadata parameters
response: 
client_id 
client_secret
registration_access_token: used at the Client Configuration Endpoint to perform subsequent operations upon the Client registration.
registration_client_uri: Location of the Client Configuration Endpoint 
client_id_issued_at
client_secret_expires_at
registered Metadata: Authorization Server MAY reject or replace any of the Client's requested field values and substitute them with suitable values.

Client Configuration Endpoint:
Client MUST use its Registration Access Token in all calls to this endpoint as an OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token
Read request: GET /connect/register?client_id=s6BhdRkqt3 HTTP/1.1
Read response: registered Metadata about Client
Authorization Server need not include the registration_access_token or registration_client_uri value in this response unless they have been updated.


------OpenID Connect Session Management------
monitor the End-User's login status at the OpenID Provider on an ongoing basis so that the Relying Party can log out an End-User who has logged out of the OpenID Provider.

Discovery Metadata:
check_session_iframe: URL of an OP iframe that supports cross-origin communications for session state information with the RP Client
end_session_endpoint: URL at the OP to which an RP can perform a redirect to request that the End-User be logged out at the OP

When the OP supports session management, it MUST also return the Session State as an additional session_state parameter in the Authentication Response.
session_state

Once the session is established with the Authentication Request and Response, it is desirable to be able to check the login status at the OP without causing network traffic by polling a hidden OP iframe from an RP iframe with an origin restricted postMessage.

RP iframe:
postMessage from the RP iframe: client_id + " " + session_state
The received data will either be "changed" or "unchanged" unless the syntax of the message sent was determined by the OP to be malformed, in which case the received data will be "error".
When the RP detects a session state change, it SHOULD first try a prompt=none request within an iframe to obtain a new ID Token and session state, sending the old ID Token as the id_token_hint.
If the RP receives an ID token for the same End-User, it SHOULD simply update the value of the session state.
If it doesn't receive an ID token or receives an ID token for another End-User, then it needs to handle this case as a logout for the original End-User.

OP iframe:

RP-Initiated Logout:
the RP, after having logged the End-User out of the RP, redirects the End-User's User Agent to the OP's logout endpoint URL.
This URL is normally obtained via the end_session_endpoint element of the OP's Discovery response
query parameters:
id_token_hint
post_logout_redirect_uri
state
